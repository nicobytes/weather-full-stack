In several endpoints, the backend will fetch the data from the OpenWeatherMap API and proccess the data to return the desired information for the frontend app and store the OpenWeatherMap KEY to not expose this key in the frontend.

### Folder structure

The backend app is organized in the following folder structure:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.module.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ api.interface.ts
â””â”€â”€ weather
    â”œâ”€â”€ weather.controller.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ weather.module.ts
    â””â”€â”€ weather.service.ts
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This project was structured as a monorepo, with the frontend and backend in the same repository, and with Github actions to detect changes in the code and deploy the app to the cloud. As part of CI/CD, the project has a linter and build step before deploying the app. The project has automatic deployment to Heroku for the API, the frontend in Cloudflare pages.
